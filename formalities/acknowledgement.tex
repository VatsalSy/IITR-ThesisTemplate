\chapter*{Acknowledgment}
First of all, I would like to thank my mentor and guide, Dr. Arup Kumar Das for introducing me to the world of research. I still remember the first day when I walked into his office, with a desire to do contribute in the field of fire and fluid dynamics. He welcomed me, an undergraduate at that time, and guided me through the inception process. It has been 4 years since then, and there has been no turning back. His passion for science and willingness to explore new things have helped me throughout this journey. Working with Dr. Das has given me an extensive idea about the modeling of physical processes, develop theories to explain the physics and finally conduct experiments to confirm them. I have learned so many things from him, related to both, the subject and life in general. I always enjoy discussions and conversations with him. Thank you, sir, for your constant support and guidance.\\
I would also like to thank my parents and sister for their willingness to support me through higher studies. In a society where graduating from a college, and seeking job represent the norm, I am lucky to be born in a family which encourages higher education. Words cannot acknowledge the support I have received from them.\\
Next, I would like to mention my friends, Rahul, Sonali, Prarthana, Aditya, Yagya, and Arpit. They have stood by me throughout my stay at IIT Roorkee. If it was left to me, I would have never gone out in the social world. Thank you for always pushing and helping me to develop a great work-life balance. I would be amiss if I do not mention the special contributions from my best friend, Akanksha. For every moment in the past five years, when my codes refused to work, when the results looked impossible, when the gyroscopic balance of life was disturbed, and through every tide, thanks a lot for always being there for me. There were days when I had burnt out the motivation. Thank you for re-igniting the spark.\\
My special gratitude to Anjali, who is the best partner one can hope to have, for her love and support. It is wonderful to have someone who is willing to patiently listen to all the technical jargon. There have been times when the I have gotten new ideas from our discussions. This journey would have been difficult without your constant presence in my life. My warm hugs and a big thank you to you. A special acknowledgment to Akash, for being such a great critique of my works. and proofreading all my research publications without fail.\\
My past few years working in Two-Phase Flow \& Instability Lab were really wonderful. I really liked the lab environment, my office room, my work, and my late night stay backs to finish works. I loved the place not just because of the work, but also because of the people around me. I would like to take this chance to thank my seniors and colleagues, Parmod Kumar and Saikat Datta, for their constant help in technical and non-technical aspects. Our late night discussions on different topics of Fluid Mechanics and the workings of Gerris have always concluded with interesting insights. The enthusiasm we share for Physics is something I will cherish throughout my life. My sincere thanks to Digvijay Singh, Lokesh Rohilla, Dr. B. K. Rana, and all other members of the group for their constant support. I must also thank Sneha Malhotra for so many discussions we have had. I still maintain that theory is more important than applications. I would also like to mention my juniors, Sandeep, Anurag, Abhinav, and Mihir for their help with the work, and their dedication to the lab. I have been privileged to be surrounded by such curious people, who have taught me never to forgo the eagerness to learn new things. Along the same lines, I would also like to thank my high-school Physics teacher, Mr. Rohit Dewan for making me curious enough to explore the field.\\
I am grateful to Prof. J-P. Matas and Prof. J. J. Jerome, for giving an opportunity to work in their lab during the summers of 2016. It has been a great learning experience for me. The tricks and techniques related to post-processing of simulation data that I have learned there helped in the work I have presented here. The internship also strengthened my resolve to continue in the field of academia. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. K. M. Singh for motivating me throughout my stay. The way he taught the course on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), which forms a major part of my research work, is unique and incredible. I would also like to thank all the faculty members of I.I.T. Roorkee, who taught me in the last five years, for keeping my interest in Fluid Dynamics alive. The fundamental courses on Thermodynamics by Dr. S. Dutta and Prof. R. P. Gakkhar, on Fluid Dynamics by Prof. B. K. Gandhi, on Modeling \& Simulations by Dr. K. Murugesan, and on Heat \& mass transfer by Prof. R. Kumar and Prof. A. Gupta have been vital for my work. In addition, the applied courses by Dr. A. Bansal, Dr. M. Mishra, and Dr. A. Kumar have made me realize the importance of Mechanical Engineering.\\
Last but not the least, I would like to express my deep recognition for IIT Roorkee, my alma mater. The quiet, lush green campus, the historical and magnificent main building, and the beautiful Ganges canal were always there when I needed a long walk to clear my head. Furthermore, I cannot thank enough the well-maintained Mahatma Gandhi Central Library (MGCL) for providing access to almost all internationally acclaimed journals. Finally, I acknowledge everyone who has been a part of my life for helping me, in one way or the other, through the course of this endeavor.
