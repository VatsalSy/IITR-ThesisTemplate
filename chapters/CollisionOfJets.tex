\chapter{Collision of liquid jets}\label{Chapter::results}
\section{Collision and Sheet formation}
As the laminar liquid jets collide, a thin sheet bounded by thicker rims is formed in the median plane, perpendicular to the axes of the jets. The initialization of the liquid jets is done using small inclined cylinders with circular cross-section as shown in equation~\ref{Equation::cylindricalJet}.
\begin{equation}\label{Equation::cylindricalJet}
\frac{|(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x_1})\times(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x_2})|}{|\mathbf{x_2} - \mathbf{x_1}|} = \frac{d_j}{2}
\end{equation}
Here, $\mathbf{x}$ is the loci of the cylinder with axis marked by the vector $\mathbf{x_2 - x_1}$ and $d_j$ is the diameter of the cylinder. Across this inclined cylinder, a parabolic velocity profile is patched as discussed in section~\ref{sec::process}. In this section, the formation of chain structure due to the collision of liquid jets is discussed and the temporal variation of the phenomena is illustrated. This is followed by the study of the kinematics of fluid parcels inside the liquid sheet. At last, the three-dimensional streamline structure is discussed.
\subsection{The process of chain formation}
Figure~\ref{Figure::temporal} shows temporal evolution of the fluid sheet when the two jets (shown in figure~\ref{Figure::temporal}(a)) collide. The reference for temporal variations is kept at the instant when the jets collide. The fluid parcels are dispatched radially outwards from the point of impingement. In case of the head on collision of the liquid jets ($\alpha$ = 90\degree), the sheet formed is always radial in the absence of gravity \citep{eggers2008physics} and the point of stagnation is in-line with the two liquid jets \citep{inamura2014effect}. However, in this case the net inertia of jets and gravity result in a bay leaf like sheet as shown in figures~\ref{Figure::temporal}(b) and~\ref{Figure::temporal}(c). Present zone of consideration lies in 0.5 $< Fr <$ 4, where gravity plays a major role unlike \cite{bush2004collision,bremond2006atomization}. In absence of surface tension or at very high Weber number, the sheet keeps on expanding (figures~\ref{Figure::temporal}(d) and~\ref{Figure::temporal}(e)), leading to the formation of the open rim structures \citep{taylor1960formation,chen2013high}. However, due to the action of the surface tension, the sheet stops expanding and the two rims are formed at the periphery because of the accumulation of the fluid parcels from the liquid sheet. Surface tension also provides the necessary centripetal acceleration to sustain the liquid rims. These rims undergo a second oblique collision (figure~\ref{Figure::temporal}(f)) at an angle smaller than the initial collision (figure~\ref{Figure::temporal}(b)). After the secondary impingement, similar to figure~\ref{Figure::temporal}(c), a flow biased sheet begins to develop (figure~\ref{Figure::temporal}(g)). Formation of this second link has no effect on the characteristics features of the primary link as the sheet speed is supercritical \citep{bush2004collision}, and therefore can be independently studied.\\
Temporal advancement results in the formation of a full-fledged secondary link as shown in figures~\ref{Figure::temporal}(h) to~\ref{Figure::temporal}(j). It must be noted that the plane of formation of this sheet is orthogonal to that of the primary link and therefore the secondary link shares the same plane as the axes of the jets. The process continues and a series of mutually orthogonal links are obtained, successively reducing in size until a long single liquid jet is formed \citep{bush2004collision}. After the initial transients, as seen from figure~\ref{Figure::temporal} and its inset, the links become steady (non-dimensionalized time, $T \left(\frac{u_jt}{d_j}\right) = $ 8.5 as representation in primary link), which has been analyzed further.

The variation of $d_1$ and $l_1$ with time is shown in inset ($\alpha$, $Fr$, $Re/Fr$, $Bo$ = 30\degree, 2.5, 34, 5). The video for this figure is added as a supplementary material.}

\subsection{Velocity variation inside the sheet}
\begin{figure*}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{chapters/Figure5}
	\caption{Flow kinematics of the fluid parcels: (a) velocity vector field for two representative cases, (b) variation of velocity in the radial direction for four representative cases and (c) their radially averaged sheet velocity $\left(u_s(\theta)\right)$, non-dimensionalized with the average sheet velocity $\left(u_0\right)$ along the azimuthal direction in the sheet. The parameters identifying the identity of the cases follow ($\alpha$, $Fr$, $Re/Fr$, $Bo$).}
	\label{Figure::velocityVectors}
\end{figure*}
Jets progress towards each other and collide at a point in the median sheet plane to form a sheet bounded by leaf-like rims. Fast moving, the thin sheet possess radial velocity pattern emerging from a stagnation point, $\delta_\pi$ higher than the impingement location. \cite{inamura2014effect} have established $\delta_\pi = \lambda d_j/(2\sin\alpha)$, where the factor $\lambda$ is a function of the impingement angle. It needs to be noted that $\delta_\pi$ changes its value, depending upon the angle of impingement and can be taken as a parameter. Considering $\delta_\pi$ and velocity vectors obtained from numerical simulations for two sets of non-dimensional numbers, flow pattern inside the sheet is reported in figure~\ref{Figure::velocityVectors}(a). It can be observed that velocity vectors follow a self-similar smooth path, as traced by sheet boundary. An increase of sheet span can be also noticed from the figure for a higher velocity of impacting jets.\\
An effort has been made to observe the local sheet velocity $\left(u_f(r,\theta)\right)$ at a given radial and azimuthal point. The local sheet velocity $\left(u_f(r,\theta)\right)$ was first used by \cite{choo2002velocity} and denotes the steady average flow across the thickness of the sheet. Moreover, figure~\ref{Figure::velocityVectors}(a) shows the presence of both radial and azimuthal components of the velocity vectors. Therefore, the local sheet velocity $\left(u_f(r,\theta)\right)$ can be expressed as equation~\ref{Equation::uf}, where $Y$ is the coordinate direction parallel to link's thickness.
\begin{equation}\label{Equation::uf}
u_f(r,\theta) = \int_{0}^{1}\sqrt{V_iV_i}d(Y/h)
\end{equation}
$V_i$ denotes the velocity field in Cartesian-tensor notation and $\sqrt{V_iV_i}$ is the total magnitude of the velocity given by $\sqrt{V_r^2 + V_\theta^2 + V_z^2}$. Azimuthal and radial velocities are considered here to accommodate spread of fluid streams, forming chain and subsequent links in orthogonal planes. The variation of the local sheet velocity $\left(u_f(r,\theta)\right)$ along radial plane at different azimuthal angles have been shown in figure~\ref{Figure::velocityVectors}(b). It can be observed that the order of change in the fluid velocity across the radial distance from the point of impact is less than the change across the azimuthal direction (also discussed by \cite{choo2002velocity}). Making use of this feature, the sheet velocity $\left(u_s(\theta)\right)$ in a particular azimuthal direction has been also obtained by integrating the local sheet velocity $u_f(r,\theta)$ as given by equation~\ref{Equation::us}. This sheet velocity $\left(u_s(\theta)\right)$ gives a measure of the velocity of dispatch of fluid parcel in a given azimuthal direction.
\begin{equation}\label{Equation::us}
u_s(\theta) = \int_{0}^{1}u_f(r,\theta)d\left(\frac{r}{r_{max}(\theta)}\right)
\end{equation} 
It must be noted that $r_{max}(\theta)$ is the maximum radial spread of the liquid sheet in a particular azimuthal direction ($\theta$). Upon non-dimensionalization of sheet velocity with its average $\left(u_0 = \int_{0}^{\pi}u_s(\theta)d\theta\right)$, a self-similar behavior in azimuthal direction is observed for a wide diversity of non-dimensional parameters reported in figure~\ref{Figure::velocityVectors}(c). In this figure, four arbitrarily chosen parameters are shown which adhere to a functional relationship of $u_s(\theta)$ in the following fashion: 
\begin{equation}\label{Equation::usu0}
\frac{u_s(\theta)}{u_0} = 1.03 + 0.13\cos\left(\frac{4.18\theta}{\pi}\right)
\end{equation}
It needs to be noted that the equation~\ref{Equation::usu0} is valid for a large range of non-dimensional numbers explored in the present study, forming stable chain structure (0\degree $< \alpha \le$  45\degree, $Fr \sim$ 1, $Bo \sim$ 1 and 10 $\le Re \le$ 2300).  Using figure~\ref{Figure::velocityVectors} and equation~\ref{Equation::usu0}, it can be realized that the thickness-averaged velocity field in equation~\ref{Equation::uf} is a function of only one coordinate $X$ and the functional dependence on coordinates $r$, $\theta$ is only through their combination $X = r\cos\theta$. Further, the integration in equation~\ref{Equation::us} over the radial direction is equivalent to the integral of function of local sheet velocity ($u_f$) over the interval $X \in \{0, r_{max}(\theta)\cos\theta\}$. The resulting function of sheet velocity will then be implicitly dependent on the azimuthal direction. Moreover, equation~\ref{Equation::usu0} clearly demonstrates that the non-dimensional sheet velocity $\left(\frac{u_s(\theta)}{u_0}\right)$ differs from unity (as predicted by \cite{choo2002velocity}). The sheet velocity $\left(u_s(\theta)\right)$ not only represents the kinematics of the flow field inside the link but also acts as a transition parameter. The chain structure no longer remains stable because of Kelvin - Helmholtz instability if $u_s$ exceeds a limit \citep{villermaux2002life}. The discussion so far gives an idea about the two-dimensional velocity field. Next we discuss the three dimensional velocity field with an aid of streamlines and vectors at different locations to explain the subsequent collisions.
\subsection{Three dimensional streamline structure}
\begin{figure*}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{chapters/Figure6}
	\caption{Three dimensional velocity field for ($\alpha, Fr, Re/Fr, Bo$) = (30$\degree$, 2, 1125, 3.4) with (a) XY plane streamlines, (b) velocity vector field in the YZ plane at different collision locations, (c) the three dimensional stable chain structure, (d) streamlines at maximum link widths in the YZ plane and (e) XZ plane streamlines.}
	\label{Figure::streamDetails}
\end{figure*}
An overall consideration of the three-dimensional chain structure (figure~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}(c)) allows us to obtain velocity patterns at different axial locations. The streamlines follow steadily the phase contour boundary, with those inside the chain structure going in trajectories similar to the outer boundary as shown in figures~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}(a) and~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}(e). Figure~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}(b) puts an effort towards highlighting velocity vectors at primary, secondary and tertiary links. One can observe from figure~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}(b) that the spread of liquid influence at collision planes is reducing continuously as $X/d_j$ increases.  At the primary ($X/d_j$ = 0) and tertiary ($X/d_j$ = 12.5) collision points, the liquid jets and rims respectively converge onto themselves ($Z/d_j$ = 0) marked by retracting velocity field, whereas the liquid sheet grows ($Y/d_j$ = 0) in the Z direction, marked by an expanding velocity field. Trends opposite to these are obtained at the secondary ($X/d_j$ = 6.40) and quaternary ($X/d_j$ = 18.45) collision planes where a retracting velocity field is present at $Y/d_j$ = 0 and expansion happens at $Z/d_j$ = 0. This leads to the formation of three visible orthogonal links in this case (figure~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}(c)). The velocity vector magnitudes go on increasing at each subsequent collision planes as the gravitational head is converted to dynamic head leading to narrowing of the extent of liquid phase boundary in the XZ plane. In the primary link, this converging-diverging trend of velocity vectors is continued from above the first collision point ($X/d_j$ = 0) to the plane where the extent of the link perpendicular to the net flow direction in the plane of the link is maximum ($X/d_j$ = 3.12). As illustrated in figure~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}(d), the streamlines at the location of maximum width imply that the component of velocity perpendicular to the liquid sheet phase boundary is zero ($\frac{d\Psi}{dn}$ = 0). This results in the formation of distinguished circulation patterns inside the lobes at the locations of the maximum extent ($X/d_j$ = 3.12, 9.14 and 15.25) corresponding to the three links visible in this case. Reduction of collision strength at different planes explains diminishing spans of the links, which can be also seen from sheet cross-sectional images (figure~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}(d)).\\
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{chapters/Figure7}
	\caption{Three dimensional streamlines embedded on the chain structure illustrating the twist incurred as they traverse through the region of subsequent collisions for $\alpha$ = $30\degree$, $Fr$ = 2, $Bo$ = 3.4 and (a) $Re/Fr$ = 1750 and (b) $Re/Fr$ = 34. The figures in inset show the offset ($\delta y$ from XZ plane and $\delta z$ from XY plane) of the streamline at the extreme end of the chain structure as it moves downstream with the flow for the corresponding cases.}
	\label{Figure::stream3D}
\end{figure}
A characteristic twist can be found in streamlines (figure~\ref{Figure::stream3D}) as the flow propagates downstream through the locations of subsequent collisions. The twist occurs as the fluid parcels are restricted by surface tension to follow the chain's outer periphery. This twist is characterized by the offset of these streamlines from the two mutually orthogonal planes: the XY plane containing the axes of the liquid jets ($\delta z$) and the XZ median plane orthogonal to this one ($\delta y$). The offset of the most extreme streamline are shown in the inset of figure~\ref{Figure::stream3D} for two representative cases having different ratios of Reynolds Number and Froude Number ($Re/Fr$ = 1750 in figure~\ref{Figure::stream3D}(a) and $Re/Fr$ = 34 in~\ref{Figure::stream3D}(b)). The offset of all the streamlines from the XZ plane ($\delta y$) decreases continuously as the liquid jets approach each other (retracting velocity field as shown in figure~\ref{Figure::streamDetails}(b)). After the collision, two extreme streamlines in XZ and XY planes are depicted in the inset of figures~\ref{Figure::stream3D} (a) and~\ref{Figure::stream3D} (b). It is observed that $\delta y$ decreases continuously through the first link, but downstream of the second collision, the offset starts to increase, reaching the maxima at the location of the maximum width of the secondary link. The opposite trend is observed for the XY plane whereby the offset ($\delta z$) increases after the first collision continuously till the maximum width of the primary link and then decreases for the secondary link. These variations in the offset in streamlines show the presence of twist, which is prominent until viscous effects start dominating and only a single jet of liquid is left at the end of the chain structure (as shown in figure~\ref{Figure::stream3D}(b) beyond $X/d_j$ = 16). These viscous forces lead to dissipation of energy as the liquids jets (or rims for the post-primary link) collide with each other. It is clear from our discussions above that values of dimensionless numbers $\alpha$, $Fr$, $Bo$ and $Re/Fr$ determine the three-dimensional stable chain structures. The next section is devoted to analyzing such effects.
\section{Parametric Variation}
Formation of the liquid sheet bounded by the rims is governed by inertia, viscous, buoyancy and surface forces apart from the angle of impingement between the jets ($\alpha$). The relative importance of these forces is described by the parameters $Fr$, $Bo$ and $Re/Fr$, as mentioned above. In this section, critical assessment of chain shapes is made for various non-dimensional numbers and impingement angles.  \cite{yang2014liquid} acknowledged the importance of these parameters on collision process and formation of the first link. This analysis is used to generalize the effects of these parameters on the dimensions of first link to the entire chain structure. The study is followed by the development of a regression model for the prediction of the shape and size of the first link using the control parameters of the liquid jets. 
\subsection{Variation of control parameters}

	\label{Figure::phaseContours}
\end{figure*}
Figure~\ref{Figure::phaseContoursLink1} shows the effects of the variation of the non-dimensional parameters on the first link which can be generalized in figure~\ref{Figure::phaseContours} for the entire chain structure. Figures~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}(a)-~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}(d) show numerical chain structure for a several sets of parameters $\alpha$, $Fr$, $Bo$ and $Re/Fr$. An increase in impingement angle leads to decrease of jet momentum in direction of gravity ($u_j\cos\alpha$). Further, it must be noted that the sheet dimension in the direction parallel to that of gravity is dominated by the loss in gravitational potential \citep{taylor1960formation}, which remains unaffected during the transition. Further, the jet momentum in the plane perpendicular to the gravity is increased ($u_j\sin\alpha$). These effects result in a substantial increase in width of the sheet, keeping the length more or less intact (figures~\ref{Figure::phaseContoursLink1}(a) and~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}(a)). Alternatively, as the jet momentum is increased (increase in $Fr$), the resulting links are bigger (figures~\ref{Figure::phaseContoursLink1}(b) and~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}(b)) due to the fluid inertia. The increment can be explained with the fact that the increase in $Fr$ or jets' momenta is directed related to the increase in the strength of the jets which in turn is a measure of the expansion tendency of the liquid sheets \citep{yang2014liquid}. One can clearly see this effect is transmitted to the subsequent links as well. Further, the surface tension is a crucial entity which influences the expansion of the link. As the surface tension is decreased ($Bo$ increased), the link can expand until inertial and centrifugal forces balance it. This justifies obtaining larger links for higher values of $Bo$ as seen in figures~\ref{Figure::phaseContoursLink1}(c) and~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}(c). As the surface tension is increased (low $Bo$ regime), the system tries to go towards the minimum surface energy decreasing the dimensions of the corresponding links (link in figure~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}(c) from $Bo$ = 6 to 2). Further, the collision of cylindrical jets and rims is also observed to be influenced by viscous dissipations. Decreasing the viscosity (increasing $Re/Fr$) leads to considerable increase in sheet dimensions but its effect saturates at lower ranges of liquid viscosities (figures~\ref{Figure::phaseContoursLink1}(d) and~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}(d)). This can be easily illustrated by observing the change in sheet dimension from $Re/Fr$ = 12.5 to $Re/Fr$ = 37.5 as compared to the change from $Re/Fr$ = 187.5 to $Re/Fr$ = 1725. Effect of change in liquid viscosity dies down as inertia and surface tension overshadow its resistance to form similar shape and sizes of links. It can also be noticed that it is the viscous dissipations that result in the decrement in the size of subsequent links leading to a point where the sheet coalesces into a single jet of fluid. The effect is prominent in figure~\ref{Figure::phaseContours}(d) for $Re/Fr$ = 12.5.\\
\subsection{Prediction of chain structure using regression analysis}
Considering $\Delta Z$ is the rim to rim distance at a particular vertical location ($X$) of the symmetric sheet, a third order polynomial is used to fit ($R^2 >$ 0.975; $SSE <$ 0.01) the sheet shape for various influencing parameters. The functional form of the polynomial is as follows: 
\begin{equation}\label{Equation::correlation}
\frac{\Delta Z}{2d_j} = \sum_{n = 0}^{n = 3}p_n\left(\frac{X}{d_j}\right)^n
\end{equation}

\end{table}
Efforts are also made to relate polynomial coefficients $\left(p_n\right)$ with non-dimensional numbers using linear regression analysis. Hence, $p_n$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}\label{Equation::CorelationCoefficeints}
p_n = C_{0,n}\left(\sin\alpha\right)^{C_{1,n}}\left(Fr\right)^{C_{2,n}}\left(Bo\right)^{C_{3,n}}\left(Re\right)^{C_{4,n}}
\end{equation}
Values of $C_{m,n} \left(\forall\:\: m \in {0,4}\right)$ in equation~\ref{Equation::CorelationCoefficeints} are tabulated in the table~\ref{Table::polyfit} obeying $R^2$ norm of regression higher than 0.925. Predictability of the correlation with numerical chain contours are shown in the insets of figure~\ref{Figure::polyfit} for two different cases of non-dimensional numbers. It can be also observed from figure~\ref{Figure::polyfit} that the developed correlation gives a very good match ($\pm$5\%) with the numerical sheet profiles. So as to check the capability of the correlation, for prediction of experimental profiles of the chain structure, the comparison is made between observation of \cite{bush2004collision} and equation~\ref{Equation::correlation}. The reported excellent match in the inset of figure~\ref{Figure::polyfit} confirms the universality of the developed correlation. It is essential to understand the formation physics of widely influenced sheet structure generated due to the collision of jets. Next section dedicatedly discusses the issue.
\section{Analytical Model}
To bring out the physical insights of the liquid jet collision, idealizations are made for tracing back the sheet profile as a result of the collision between a train of fluid quanta (each of mass $m$), analogous to jet, in the plane of the sheet. It is assumed that the fluid quantum in a given jet interacts only with its mirror image in the other jet and that they are non-deformable. The collision is taken as friction-less. However, the follow-up trajectory of these fluid parcels after the collision is considered damped so as to mimic resistive forces like viscous and surface tension. A free body diagram and schematic of the fluid quanta collision assumption to replicate the sheet structure is depicted in figure~\ref{Figure::analytical}(a). Apart from inertial and gravitational forces, on the fluid particle, a damping force of magnitude $f_n$ (to impose the effect of viscous dissipation and surface forces) is also attached in the direction perpendicular to the individual packet's instantaneous velocity, post-collision. Absence of these resistive forces will make infinitely stretched sheet \citep{taylor1960formation}, with $f_n$ = 0 case. In-situ assessment of damping force based on local velocity may improve the prediction of resistive forces which has not been targeted in the present effort. Reference frame for the trajectory of the fluid quantum ($\zeta$) is considered to have the origin at the point of collision with $\zeta$ = 0 at $X$ = 0. Free body force analysis of the fluid particle, post-collision can be expressed as equations~\ref{Equation::tangential} and~\ref{Equation::normal}, with accelerations $a_n$ and $a_t$ in normal ($n$) and tangential ($t$) directions respectively.
\begin{subequations}%
	\label{Equation::forceBal}	
	\begin{eqnarray}
	\label{Equation::tangential}
	\text{Direction t:}\:\:\: a_t = v_{q}\frac{dv_{q}}{ds} &=& g\cos\phi\\
	\label{Equation::normal}
	\text{Direction n:}\:\:\: a_n = g\sin\phi + \frac{f_n}{m} &=& \frac{v_{q}^2}{r_c}
	\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
\begin{figure*}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{chapters/Figure10}
	\caption{Fluid quanta collision analogy: (a) schematic of the model and free-body diagram and comparison between the link shape obtained through numerical simulations and the fluid quantum trajectory ($\zeta$, \protect\MarkerSquareRed) for ($\alpha$, $Fr$, $Re/Fr$, $Bo$) = (a) (30$\degree$, 2.5, 34, 5), (b) (30$\degree$, 2.5, 23, 3.85), (d) (30$\degree$, 2, 34, 4.56) and (e) (45$\degree$, 2, 34, 3.4).}

\end{figure*}%
Here, $r_c$ is the radius of curvature in $\zeta-X$ plane and $\phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{d\zeta}{dX}\right)$. Integrating tangential momentum equation with increment $ds = dX/\cos\phi$ along with boundary condition at $X$ = 0, instantaneous fluid particle velocity ($v_{q}$) can be obtained as $\sqrt{u_j^2 + 2gX}$. Rearrangement of momentum equation in the normal direction after defining $\Lambda$ as $\frac{f_n}{mg}$ and inertial length scale, $\chi$ equivalent to $\frac{u_j^2}{2g}$, one obtains:
\begin{equation}\label{Equation::Final1}
r_c\left(\sin\phi + \Lambda\right) = 2\chi\left(\frac{X}{\chi} + 1\right)
\end{equation} 
After necessary integration, equation~\ref{Equation::Final1} simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
\sin\phi  = \sin\alpha + \left(\Lambda + \sin\alpha\right)\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{X}{\chi} + 1}} - 1\right)	
\end{equation}
Recalling that $\tan\phi = \frac{d\zeta}{dX}$ and expressing $\Lambda/\sin\alpha = \eta$, profile of fluid quantum movement can be characterized as:
\begin{equation}
\label{Equation::AnaFinal}
\frac{d\zeta}{dX} = \tan\left\lbrace\sin^{-1}\left[ \sin\phi_0\left(1 + \eta\right)\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{X}{\chi} + 1}} - 1\right) \right]\right\rbrace
\end{equation}
The functional form of the fluid particle trajectory, the equivalence of sheet profile, can be integrated numerically to obtain the coordinate points in the $\zeta-X$ plane after tuning only control factor, $\eta$ from some simulated profiles. In this process, $L^1$ relative error norm is kept below 10\%. Efforts have been also made to express control parameter, $\eta$ in terms of non-dimensional numbers for the range of values presented in this work. With 99\% $R^2$ regression norm, $\eta$ can be related with non-dimensional numbers as:
\begin{equation}\label{Equation::eta}
\eta = 3.28(\sin\alpha)^{-0.077}(Fr)^{0.502}(Bo)^{-0.248}\left(Re\right)^{-0.084}
\end{equation}
Proposed concept of collision of fluid quanta for mimicking the sheet profile is also tested with phase contours of numerical simulations. Some representative matches are shown in figures~\ref{Figure::analytical}(b) -~\ref{Figure::analytical}(e) in connection of primary link. Fundamental analysis of forces, a single controlling parameter in sheet profile (equation~\ref{Equation::AnaFinal}) and an excellent match with numerical data supplies in-depth knowledge about the formation of the liquid chain. Next, we focus on the mutual relationship between links formed at successive orthogonal planes.

The secondary and tertiary links observed in mutually perpendicular planes initiate with the collision of rims in preceding links. From our numerous simulations in the wide range of operating parameters, it can be observed that secondary, tertiary and subsequent links of a chain are equivalent to primary, secondary and subsequent links of another chain having different operating parameters. Hence, it is proposed that subsequent links are equivalent to resultant of collision between two free jets having reduced strength. To prove our  assumption, for example in figure~\ref{Figure::secondCollision}(a), a representative chain structure is identified for $\alpha$ = 30$\degree$, $Fr$ = 2.5, $Bo$ = 4, $Re/Fr$ = 34 (Case 1), in which secondary links showed resemblance with primary link of $\alpha$ = 25$\degree$, $Fr$ = 2.2, $Bo$ = 4, $Re/Fr$ = 34 (Case 2). Continuing this one can also establish analogy among tertiary link of Case 1, secondary link of Case 2 and primary link of $\alpha$ = 11.25$\degree$, $Fr$ = 1.98, $Bo$ = 4, $Re/Fr$ = 34 (Case 3). One to one correspondence of these links of different cases establishing present proposal is shown in the comparative graph of figure~\ref{Figure::secondCollision}(b). \\
It can be commented that subsequent links are reduced in size, giving a feeling of resultant of impact between two weaker jets. The analogy between interconnected links in a chain and one level lower link of another chain is found to be valid with $\pm$ 10\% confidence for the entire region of search space of the operating parameters ($\alpha$, $Fr$, $Re/Fr$, $Bo$). A critical assessment of links in chain structure and rim profile has also established that angle of impingement between rims successively reduces $\alpha_{n}/\alpha_{n-1} < 1 \:\:\forall\:\: n = 1, 2, 3 \:\:\text{and higher integers}$. It has been also checked that analogy of collision between fluid parcels and formation of the link by the interaction between rims is also valid after taking the reduction of angle of impingement into consideration. This trend is shown in the figures~\ref{Figure::secondGraph}(a) -~\ref{Figure::secondGraph}(b) for secondary and tertiary links for few chain cases randomly scattered in search space. With only $\pm$ 10\% error, theory of collision between the fluid quanta (equations~\ref{Equation::AnaFinal} -~\ref{Equation::eta}) has also found to be applicable for $n^{th}$ order link of chain. Polynomial proposed in equation~\ref{Equation::correlation} also predicts formation of $n^{th}$ order link satisfactorily with modified strength and impingement angle. Clustering of points near (1,1) for secondary link (figure~\ref{Figure::secondGraph}(a)) and (0,0) for tertiary link (figure~\ref{Figure::secondGraph}(b)) establishes continuous reduction of impingement angle $\alpha_{n}$ with increase in link number $n$. Besides the reduction in angle of impingements, the interaction between rims of a link can be also considered as the collision between jets of lesser Froude number ($Fr_m$) than $Fr_j$. The monotonous decrement of $Fr_m$ is observed as one traverses in subsequent higher level links along a chain. Figure~\ref{Figure::secondGraph}(c) establishes this idea where the ratio between rim Froude number of secondary link ($Fr_2$) to jet Froude number ($Fr_j$) has been fitted as 0.88 and that of same for the tertiary link ($Fr_3/Fr_j$) as 0.8.\\

These decrements are a result of the viscous dissipations which are prominent at the time of the collision and has been illustrated in figure~\ref{Figure::secondLink} (with the extreme cases of variations shown as insets figures across each graph) for the entire domain of non-dimensional numbers considered in the present work. The dimensional characteristics of the secondary and tertiary links are studied as relative to the primary link. The range of values of $l_i/l_1$ and $d_i/d_1$ is always less than 1. Further, it must be noted that the final resultant liquid jet formed after the diminishing of chain structure also shows some undulations on its surface. Therefore, we have considered the presence of higher order links only if the difference in relative dimensional characteristics is more than 30$\%$. For fluids with higher viscosities, the formation of this resultant jet is most prominent as shown in figure~\ref{Figure::secondLink}(a). As the viscosity is decreased ($Re$ is increased), there is a sudden increase in the dimensional characteristics because of the reduced viscous dissipations at the time of collision of subsequent rims of the sheet. However, similar to the effects of $Re$ on single link dimensions, this influence saturates after the initial increase as for the less viscous fluids (high $Re$), the formation of chain structure is surface tension and inertia driven. Further, with an increase in the inertia of the liquid jets, the individual links grow in size but because of the viscous dissipations, this effect is not transmitted equally downstream of the flow. The second link also increases in dimensions but the length and width of the second link are always smaller than the primary link (figure~\ref{Figure::secondLink}(b)). Moreover, an increase in the $Bo$ (decrement in the surface tension coefficient of the interface), the length and width of the first link increase substantially \citep{yang2014liquid,bremond2006atomization}. As a result, the primary sheet thickness and the rim diameter decrease leading to the reduction of the inertia of the rims responsible for the secondary and subsequent collisions. Therefore, the dimensional characteristics of the higher order links as compared to the first one decreases with an increase in $Bo$ (figure~\ref{Figure::secondLink}(c)). A similar decrement in also observed if the angle of impingement is increased (figure~\ref{Figure::secondLink}(d)) as the primary link grows faster in size than the others. Though the idea of the interrelation between the links is established only for first three, it can be extrapolated for higher order elements in the chain until it transforms into a jet.
